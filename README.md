# MECE Problem-Solving App

Welcome to the MECE Problem-Solving App README. This document provides a detailed overview of our application, including how to get started, use the app effectively, and where to find additional support.

## Introduction

The MECE Problem-Solving App is an AI-powered tool designed to help users structure and solve complex problems using the Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) principle. By breaking down problems into clear, non-overlapping categories, the app facilitates a comprehensive approach to problem-solving.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Describe your problem in detail, and the app will provide a structured MECE decomposition.
- **Saved Problems History**: Review and revisit your past problems and the solutions provided by the app.
- **Execution Plan**: After reviewing your MECE decomposition, the app will help you form a clear action plan to tackle the problem.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Add gemini API key in the second cell.
2. **Dependencies**: You need to have a gemini API key.
3. **Running the App**: Run all the cells. Use username: 'testUsername' and password 123456

## Usage

Upon launching the app, you'll be guided through an introductory screen that explains the MECE principle and how to use the app. Afterward, you'll enter the main chat interface, where you can describe your problem.

If you're using the app for the first time, we recommend going through the Quick Questionnaire to provide the AI with more context about your problem. This step can significantly enhance the relevance of the MECE categories and the subsequent execution plan provided by the app.

Your problems are automatically saved in the history for later review. You can access the history from the main menu.

## Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction

Our app adheres to the following human-AI interaction guidelines:

- **Make clear what the system can do**: The initial explanatory screens and tooltips throughout the app clarify its capabilities.
- **Timely and contextually relevant information**: The app provides MECE breakdowns and action plans immediately after problem input.
- **Support efficient correction**: After receiving the initial MECE decomposition, users can correct the AI by sending problem with more details.
## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about using the app, please refer to our FAQ section or contact our support team at anna.gur@campus.technion.ac.il or or amirsteiner@campus.technion.ac.il
